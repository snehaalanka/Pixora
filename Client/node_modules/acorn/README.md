# Acorn

A tiny, fast JavaScript parser written in JavaScript.

## Community

Acorn is open source software released under an
[MIT license](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/master/acorn/LICENSE).

## Installation

The easiest way to install acorn is from [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install acorn
```

Alternately, you can download the source and build acorn yourself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acornjs/acorn.git
cd acorn
npm install
```

## Interface

**parse**`(input, options)` is the main interface to the library. The
`input` parameter is a string, `options` must be an object setting
some of the options listed below. The return value will be an abstract
syntax tree object as specified by the [ESTree
spec](https://github.com/estree/estree).

```javascript
let acorn = require("acorn");
console.log(acorn.parse("1 + 1", {ecmaVersion: 2020}));
```

When encountering a syntax error, the parser will raise a
`SyntaxError` object with a meaningful message. The error object will
have a `pos` property that indicates the string offset at which the
error occurred, and a `loc` object that contains a `{line, column}`
object referring to that same position.

Options are provided by in a second argument, which should be an
object containing any of these fields (only `ecmaVersion` is
required):

- **ecmaVersion**: Indicates the ECMAScript version to parse. Can be a
  number, either in year (`2022`) or plain version number (`6`) form,
  or `"latest"` (the latest the library supports). This influences
  support for strict mode, the set of reserved words, and support for
  new syntax features.

  **NOTE**: Only 'stage 4' (finalized) ECMAScript features are being
  implemented by Acorn. Other proposed new features must be
  implemented through plugins.

- **sourceType**: Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be
  either `"script"` or `"module"`. This influences global strict mode
  and parsing of `import` and `export` declarations.

  **NOTE**: If set to `"module"`, then static `import` / `export` syntax
  will be valid, even if `ecmaVersion` is less than 6.

- **onInsertedSemicolon**: If given a callback, that callback will be
  called whenever a missing semicolon is inserted by the parser. The
  callback will be given the character offset of the point where the
  semicolon is inserted as argument, and if `locations` is on, also a
  `{line, column}` object representing this position.

- **onTrailingComma**: Like `onInsertedSemicolon`, but for trailing
  commas.

- **allowReserved**: If `false`, using a reserved word will generate
  an error. Defaults to `true` for `ecmaVersion` 3, `false` for higher
  versions. When given the value `"never"`, reserved words and
  keywords can also not be used as property names (as in Internet
  Explorer's old parser).

- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: By default, a return statement at
  the top level raises an error. Set this to `true` to accept such
  code.

- **allowImportExportEverywhere**: By default, `import` and `export`
  declarations can only appear at a program's top level. Setting this
  option to `true` allows them anywhere where a statement is allowed,
  and also allows `import.meta` expressions to appear in scripts
  (when `sourceType` is not `"module"`).

- **allowAwaitOutsideFunction**: If `false`, `await` expressions can
  only appear inside `async` functions. Defaults to `true` in modules
  for `ecmaVersion` 2022 and later, `false` for lower versions.
  Setting this option to `true` allows to have top-level `await`
  expressions. They are still not allowed in non-`async` functions,
  though.

- **allowSuperOutsideMethod**: By default, `super` outside a method
  raises an error. Set this to `true` to accept such code.

- **allowHashBang**: When this is enabled, if the code starts with the
  characters `#!` (as in a shellscript), the first line will be
  treated as a comment. Defaults to true when `ecmaVersion` >= 2023.

- **checkPrivateFields**: By default, the parser will verify that
  private properties are only used in places where they are valid and
  have been declared. Set this to false to turn such checks off.

- **locations**: When `true`, each node has a `loc` object attached
  with `start` and `end` subobjects, each of which contains the
  one-based line and zero-based column
